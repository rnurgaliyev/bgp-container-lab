# BGP Lab for SREs â€“ Self-Study Guide

Welcome to the **BGP Lab for SREs**! This lab is designed to help you develop a solid understanding of BGP and networking fundamentals and troubleshooting techniques, enabling you to effectively manage and optimize network routing in large-scale environments.

## Lab Overview

This lab includes:
1. **Containerlab Topology**: A pre-configured lab setup to emulate simple real-world networking scenarios. Topology diagram is available in [PDF](topology.pdf) or [SVG](topology.svg) formats.
2. **Configuration Tasks**: Hands-on exercises to set up and optimize networking.
3. **Troubleshooting Tasks**: Practical challenges to diagnose and resolve common networking issues.

All scenarios in this lab are vendor-neutral. They focus on common BGP setups, ACLs, and firewall rules, without using vendor-specific features or forwarding settings.

## Requirements

To complete this lab, you'll need:
- **Containerlab** installed on your machine. Follow [this installation guide](https://containerlab.dev/). For MacOS users, running Containerlab via Docker Desktop might present issues. It's recommended to utilize a straightforward Linux virtual machine with Docker installed. You can follow [these instructions](VM.md) to set up a VM using Qemu and install Containerlab within it.
- A text editor for modifying configuration files. If you are using the VM, it is recommended to choose an editor that can connect to a remote machine (e.g., VSCode, Zed).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rnurgaliyev/bgp-container-lab
    cd bgp-container-lab
    ```

2. **Deploy the lab topology**:
    ```bash
    sudo containerlab deploy
    ```

3. **Access lab devices**:
    If lab topology starts successfully, you can list docker containers and run linux or BIRD commands normally
    ```
